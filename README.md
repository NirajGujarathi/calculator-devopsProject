# calculator-devopsProject
I have developed a command-line scientific calculator application for the SPE mini project. It is a Java
language based scientific calculator application with 4 operations -
* Square root function - √x
* Factorial function - x!
* Natural logarithm (base е ) - ln(x)
* Power function - x^b  <br>

The project is built using the maven build tool and, It is following DevOps practices.

**What and Why DevOps ?**
DevOps is a set of practices that combines Software Development (Dev) and IT Operations (Ops). It tries
to implement continuous build - continuous integration and continuous deployment which indeed
shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with quality software, used
mainly for quick fixes.
